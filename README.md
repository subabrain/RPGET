# New things in RPGETv4 Beta

You now can set Adminrights to your .exe File - but its still under development because there are some malware scanners which are do a false positive ...

# Known Bugs:

1. Sometimes it can be a false/positive on some Anti Virus Program... this may be an problem when setting a icon file ... (try virustotal for that)
2. A stable Version of RPGET is still under development
